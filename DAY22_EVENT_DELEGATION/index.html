    <!-- While understanding event delegation we have to understand following pointers
    1) Event Bubbling : When an event is triggered on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors. 
    2) Event Capturing : In this phase, the event starts from the root and goes down to the target element.
    3) Event Delegation : It is a technique involving adding a single event listener to a parent element that will fire for all descendants matching a selector, whether those descendants exist now or are added in the future. -->

        <ul id = "itemList">  <!--Attaching one Event listener so that it is applicable to all currnt and upcoming child Elements -->
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
<script>
    //Adding event  listener to the parent elamet
    document.getElementById("itemList").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        //checking if the clicked element is a item
        if (event.target&& event.target.nodeName === "LI") {
            alert("You clicked on " + event.target.innerText);
        }
    });
</script>
